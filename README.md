To implement different payment methods (e.g., **GPay**, **PhonePe**, **Net Banking**) using the **Factory Design Pattern**, we can structure the code to allow flexible, easily extendable payment options. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to designing this system.

### Step 1: Define a Common Interface
First, define a common interface for all payment methods, such as `Payment`. This interface will declare a method for processing payments.

```java
public interface Payment {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

### Step 2: Create Concrete Payment Classes
Create specific classes for each payment method (GPay, PhonePe, and Net Banking) that implement the `Payment` interface.

```java
public class GPay implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using GPay.");
    }
}

public class PhonePe implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PhonePe.");
    }
}

public class NetBanking implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Net Banking.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create a Factory Class
The `PaymentFactory` class will contain a method to create instances of different payment methods based on a parameter.

```java
public class PaymentFactory {
    public static Payment createPayment(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("gpay")) {
            return new GPay();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("phonepe")) {
            return new PhonePe();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("netbanking")) {
            return new NetBanking();
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown payment type");
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Use the Factory to Process Payments
In your main application code, use the `PaymentFactory` to create the appropriate payment method without directly instantiating specific payment classes.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Use the factory to get the desired payment method
        Payment paymentMethod1 = PaymentFactory.createPayment("gpay");
        paymentMethod1.pay(1000);  // Output: Paid 1000.0 using GPay.
        
        Payment paymentMethod2 = PaymentFactory.createPayment("phonepe");
        paymentMethod2.pay(500);   // Output: Paid 500.0 using PhonePe.
        
        Payment paymentMethod3 = PaymentFactory.createPayment("netbanking");
        paymentMethod3.pay(2000);  // Output: Paid 2000.0 using Net Banking.
    }
}
```

### Benefits of This Design:
- **Encapsulation**: The factory hides the instantiation logic of different payment methods.
- **Extensibility**: Adding a new payment method (e.g., PayPal) only requires adding a new class and updating the `PaymentFactory`.
- **Flexibility**: The client code is decoupled from the specific implementations of each payment method and only interacts through the `Payment` interface.

This approach makes managing and extending the payment options easy, reducing dependencies and improving maintainability.
